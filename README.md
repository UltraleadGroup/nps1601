# Gophert NPS-1601 front panel reverse engineering
The Gophert NPS-1601 is the best power supply you can get in the $50 price range and if you would like to learn more about this unit I recommend watching my review video Voltlog #255, just click the image below.

Why did I decide to reverse engineer the front panel of this power supply you might ask? Well it was a topic I had on my todo list ever since I got this unit because I feel like the user interface on this is not as nice as it could be if it had a color TFT display to show more info than what you get on those small 7 segment displays.

The entire process of reverse engineering the front panel is detailed in Voltlog #305, linked below:

In this repository you will find links to board view with all the signals traced over, a pdf of the schematic and the kicad project I used to draw the schematic. Information about the input and output signals between the control panel and the mainboard are included in the schematic. 

The schematic and component identification may not be 100% accurate.
